These are solutions to problems from the AIO
in CWEB, a system for literate programming.

To actually run these, you need a distribution
of TeX with the the 'ctangle' and 'cweave' programs.

Typing 'make' in the subdirectory of a
problem should create both the literate program
(as a pdf file) and the executable that you
can run. The input file for each program should
already be there but if it isn't, create it
before running the program; most of the programs
assume that the input file exists, as it is
meant to be running on a judging computer.
